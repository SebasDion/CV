## Summary

I love to find solutions to complex problems and figure out the best way to do it.

I am a front end developer with a strong background in back end. In the first 10 years of my career, I have been working mainly with the .Net technology in front and back end to build desktop and web applications. For the last eight years, I have enjoyed working as a developer, architect and tech lead using Angular, React and more recently, Kotlin

I love to design and code highly easy to upgrade maintainable applications that are easy to upgrade and tested.
